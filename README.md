# Ford Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ“ˆ  

This project focuses on predicting car prices from the Ford dataset (sourced from Kaggle) using machine learning techniques.  

## Steps Covered  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovered trends and relationships between features and car prices.  
- **Data Processing & Cleaning:** Removed missing values, handled inconsistencies, and prepared the dataset.  
- **Feature Engineering & Encoding:**  
  - Applied **Label Encoding** for categorical variables.  
  - Used **One-Hot Encoding** to handle non-ordinal categories.  
- **Modeling:** Trained and evaluated a **Linear Regression model** using Scikit-Learn for price prediction.  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn
